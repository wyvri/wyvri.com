                    it's everywhere, <br>
                    maybe even in our hair. <br>
                    now mother gaia isn't feeling very fair, <br>
                    yet she can't let out a great wail. <br> <br>

                    our gait through fate <br>
                    is falling off the trail. <br>
                    now earth is feeling ailed, <br>
                    its flair now tainted, <br>
                    now stained and frail. <br> <br>

                    they said its for the best, <br>
                    baited us with aided emails <br>
                    and daisy praise; <br>
                    they took claim of our brains, <br>
                    used it for their own gains; <br>
                    they saw our naivety, <br>
                    and now we're our traitors. <br><br>

                    now i shout out to no avail,<br>
                    that them in their chairs <br>
                    are all in a pair. <br>
                    they've taken our acclaim, <br>
                    reclaimed it as theirs;<br>
                    put a curtain over our air, <br>
                    as if they're not the corsairs. <br> <br>

                    this is not algebraic: <br>
                    they're taking OUR paintwork, <br>
                    proclaiming it theirs; <br>
                    they're brainwashing us, draining us, <br>
                    and yet there's no bewail! <br>

                    i'm tired of being assailed, <br>
                    of being a disdainful trainee. <br>
                    i want to be an abstainer, <br>
                    blissfully free. <br> <br>

                    now i find refrain <br>
                    in the archaic. <br>

                i'm fucking tired ai. i can admit that it's a cool technology with use cases, but it's not some sort of second coming of christ like people are treating it. <br>
                it's especially not that cool because it uses so much water and resources. <br>
                what i'm REALLY tired of is how much it's shoved down your fucking throat by every company, everywhere, all of the time. <br>
                i don't need it, so why am i forced to use it? <br>
                don't even get me started on the impacts its had on art and academics.
